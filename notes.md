Todo:
- Trivially depth reject tiles
  - Store lowest depth value in tile
  - Reject triangle if its lowest Z is higher than tiles
- Add const screen width / height settings
- Ways to benchmark performance
- Exporter improvements
  - Add support for multiple primitives/meshes
  - Add support for multiple skeletons
    - Separate exporting of skeleton, animations
- Convert rendering to lib, separate out game from rendering 

- Consider Deferred Rendering
- Use Mesh Shader instead of Vertex Shader, option to include Triangle Components
- Consider reworking Shader Input Parameters (support Vec, Mat) instead of [f32; N]
- Reconsider tiled rendering (last attempt was too slow)
